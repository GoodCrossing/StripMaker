# StripMaker
EuroScope plugin that creates and prints out customizable Flight Progress Strips

# Features
-Realistic generation of flight strips
-Integrated into EuroScope via a TAG Item
-Customizable strip formats (Not yet implemented)
-Works with ESC/POS-capable printers (Not yet implemented)

# Status
Currently, the plugin is able to generate strips for one format: UK Departures. Support for other (and user-defined) formats will be implemented down the line. Also in development is the printer integration; if you wish to print strips generated with the program, you can use the python-escpos library as a temporary work-around.

# Installation
Install by dragging the contents of the StripMaker.zip file into the EuroScope folder.
